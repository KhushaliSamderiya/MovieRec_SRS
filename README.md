# Overall description


## Product perspective

The Movie Recommender System is designed as a multi-layered web application with a modular and extensible architecture that enables personalized recommendations through streamlined user interaction, intelligent data processing, and robust API integration. At its core, the system aims to simplify the movie discovery experience by offering customized content recommendations, filtering options, and child-safe controls.

The topmost layer of the architecture comprises the User Interface (UI), which is developed using Django templates and styled with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This interface presents core features such as a search bar with dynamic filters, personalized homepages, watchlists, and profile settings.

Beneath the UI lies the Application Layer, powered by Django's backend logic. This layer handles all critical tasks including user authentication, session management, filter processing, child mode enforcement, and interaction logging. It serves as the intermediary between user actions and deeper system components.

At the center of the system lies the Recommendation Engine, which is responsible for generating personalized movie suggestions. This engine uses data derived from user profiles, watch history, filter selections, and interactions. The system is designed to eventually incorporate rule-based logic or machine learning models for deeper personalization.

The Data Layer leverages SQLite as its relational database management system. It stores user profiles, login credentials (secured with salted and peppered hash algorithms), watch history, cached metadata, and administrative activity logs. This layer ensures data persistence, rapid access, and secure separation of admin and user data.

Lastly, the system relies heavily on External APIs‚Äîparticularly The Movie Database (TMDB) API‚Äîto retrieve real-time movie information such as genres, actors, ratings, and availability. To handle API limitations and ensure reliability, a local caching mechanism is implemented.

Frequently accessed data is stored temporarily to reduce downtime, improve response times, and maintain functionality during API unavailability. This structured architecture empowers the Movie Recommender System to deliver a seamless and tailored user experience while maintaining performance, scalability, and security. Please refer to the architecture diagram 2.1.1 below for a visual representation of this system

## Product functions

This subsection provides a summary of the major functions that the software performs. Each of the major functions blankets several functional requirements that contribute to the major functionality of the program as a movie recommender.


#### Search Bar Filters

The product will provide search bar functionality, providing the user with a list of options to filter the movie results of a search. The user will be able to choose any number of filtering options from none to all as chosen from the following list:

Popularity

Genre

Actors

Commendations

Release Date

Themes

Director

Producer

‚Äã

See Appendix A.2.8 for a sequence diagram detailing the process taken to collect filter selections from the user and display the results.


#### Home Page Filters

The product will provide homepage filtering functionality, providing the user with customization control over the products filters when displaying recommendations on the homepage for the user to browse.

The product will display recommended content for a logged in user based on user data. Filters that are applied from user data will appear as headers, sorting content into:

Popular Movies

Genres the user has shown interest in

New releases

Book-to-Movie adaptations

The purpose of these features is to allow users to browse without manually searching using commonly used filters across the platform, as well as easily browse the specific user‚Äôs preferences for efficient selection.


#### Homepage Features

The product will provide a homepage visible to all users, while also restricting any additional interaction beyond viewing movie titles to users that are logged in. Any blocked interaction will redirect users to a log-in page, prompting a log-in or account creation.

Once a user has logged into their account, the homepage will display their profile photo as a button in the top right that once pressed lets a user access their saved movies, homepage settings, account settings, and Child-Mode toggle.

The homepage will contain several separations for movie recommendations by various categories such as Genre, Award-Winning, Popularity, Recent, etc. These will be displayed as horizontal lists that contain the movie name and poster for each recommendation.

Centralized at the top of the homepage will be the navigation bar, providing a search function for movie titles and additional filtering options.


#### Movie Description Pages

The product will provide a page containing information about any given movie selected by the user. The movie profile/description page will consist of the following relevant information for explaining and recommending a movie:

Title

Description

Movie Poster

Movie Clips/Trailers

Reviews and Ratings

Availability on Streaming Services and pricing

The description page will be easily accessible from the homepage or from filtered results when browsing movies by selecting the desired movie, and will be easily closed to return the user to their previous location on their homepage. See diagram 3.2.5.5.2 for a mock-up of the movie profile/description page.


#### Child-Friendly Content Recommendations

The product will provide toggleable settings titled ‚ÄúChild-Mode‚Äù to limit homepage and filter results to the appropriate child-friendly ratings. This mode will restrict available movies to ratings fetched from TMDB and will prevent access to content rated for older audiences.

The separation of content between Child-Mode being toggled on and off will also create separate recommendations based on the data acquired from preferences in each state to create safer browsing for children and accurate recommendations for adults/parents. The child recommendation data will be stored alongside the main users data, but will not modify the recommendation data acquired for the main user profile.

If an attempt is made to access inappropriate content, the system will block access with a display message notifying the user that the content is unavailable in Child-Mode.

# Specific Requirements


## External interface requirements

This section identifies all the points at which the Movie Recommender System interfaces with external entities, including users, hardware, software services, and communication protocols. These interfaces define how data is exchanged between the system and its environment and ensure seamless integration of the application within its technical ecosystem. Detailing these interfaces is essential for designing a robust, interoperable, and user-friendly system that performs consistently under varying conditions.


#### User interfaces

The User Interface (UI) of the Movie Recommender System is the primary point of interaction for end-users and is designed with an emphasis on usability, accessibility, and responsiveness. The UI will be accessible via modern browsers and will support desktops, tablets, and mobile devices using responsive design practices.

To ensure a seamless and user-friendly experience, the system incorporates consistent layouts, meaning the placement of navigation elements (such as the menu, filter options, and user profile icon) remains uniform across pages to reduce cognitive load and learning effort for users. For instance, the top navigation bar, search bar, and category-based carousels will appear in the same structure whether users are on the homepage, search results, or movie detail pages.

Clear icons refer to graphical symbols that are intuitive and universally recognizable‚Äîfor example, a magnifying glass for search, a gear icon for settings, or a user avatar for profiles. These icons help users identify actions quickly without needing textual guidance, improving efficiency and minimizing confusion.

The system also ensures accessible color contrasts by selecting color palettes that meet WCAG


# 2.1 AA standards. This includes maintaining a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, ensuring that all users‚Äîincluding those with visual impairments or color blindness‚Äîcan read and interact with content comfortably.

The UI also includes personalized home pages, movie detail views, rating/review features, and account settings. Interaction elements such as buttons, dropdowns, and form inputs will be designed to support keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Additionally, a child mode toggle, profile-based content personalization, and redirection for unauthenticated users will be seamlessly integrated.


#### Hardware interfaces

Since the system is cloud-hosted and accessed via a browser, hardware interface requirements for end-users are minimal. It is compatible with standard consumer devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. The recommended hardware configuration includes a modern processor with at least 2 GB of RAM, and an active internet connection for streaming metadata and images. Devices must support HTML5 and modern browser standards to render dynamic components like trailers, posters, and filter panels effectively. Future enhancements may require notification permissions or offline caching support depending on feature expansion.


#### Software interfaces

The backend of the Movie Recommender System is built using the Django web framework, which is responsible for managing HTTP requests, handling user sessions, executing filtering logic, and integrating with third-party movie databases. The application communicates with a local SQLite database, which stores persistent data such as user credentials, preference tags, filter interactions, session logs, and cached movie metadata.

A critical software dependency is the TMDB API, which supplies dynamic movie content including titles, genres, cast details, ratings, and streaming availability. The system may also interface with additional APIs like Rotten Tomatoes to enrich data where applicable. These software services are accessed through RESTful APIs, with JSON used as the primary format for data exchange.

To enhance reliability and performance, the system implements a robust caching mechanism. Frequently accessed data such as popular movies, genre lists, and previously recommended items are cached locally in the database. These caches are updated periodically‚Äîeither on a fixed schedule or when new data is detected‚Äîensuring data freshness while reducing API dependency.

In the event of external API downtime or rate-limiting, the system gracefully degrades by serving cached responses instead of returning error messages. Additionally, retry logic and backoff strategies are implemented to handle transient failures without overwhelming the external services. This fallback strategy ensures that users can still browse previously accessed data and receive meaningful recommendations even when external connections are temporarily unavailable.

Authentication tokens and input validation are enforced at every endpoint to ensure secure and reliable interactions with all software components. These combined strategies allow the system to maintain functionality, reduce latency, and improve the overall user experience, even in unpredictable network or API conditions.


#### Communications interfaces

Data exchange across system layers is conducted over secure HTTPS protocols, ensuring that sensitive information‚Äîsuch as passwords, reviews, and user preferences‚Äîis encrypted in transit. The frontend and backend communicate using RESTful API calls following HTTP standards (e.g., GET for data retrieval, POST for data creation).

To maintain performance at scale, the system employs rate-limiting for external APIs, asynchronous request handling, and retry logic for failed transactions. Additionally, the system logs communication events and tracks API error responses for debugging and service recovery.

As usage grows, future versions may implement WebSockets or similar technologies for real-time updates and enhanced responsiveness across client sessions.

## Performance requirements


#### API Dependency & Response Time

The Movie Recommender‚Äôs performance is heavily reliant on external APIs and their polling mechanisms. Due to the unpredictable nature of APIs, every fetch carries an inherent risk of delays or failures.

API requests should ideally complete within 0.1 to 5 seconds, depending on the volume of data being retrieved. The system shall display a progress bar or some indication that the application is working on a request.

If an API request exceeds 10 seconds, the system must trigger a timeout and notify the user with an appropriate error message.


#### Caching & Data Persistence

All fetched movie data should be cached to improve response time and reduce repetitive API calls.

Cached movie entries should remain in the database for up to one month unless accessed recently. If a movie entry is not requested within this timeframe, it should be automatically removed to optimize storage and performance.


#### Scalability

The system must auto-scale to support double peak traffic during high-demand periods.

Cloud infrastructure should support horizontal scaling when CPU usage exceeds 75%.


#### Availability & Reliability

The web application must maintain 99.99% uptime annually.

Scheduled downtime should not exceed 30 minutes per month for maintenance.


#### Load Testing & Stress Testing

Load testing should simulate 200,000 concurrent users without crashing.

Stress testing should identify breakpoints under 5x normal traffic loads.


#### Database Performance

Query execution time must be under 250 milliseconds for common requests.

Cache system must reduce direct database hits by at least 50%.


## Design Constraints


#### Framework and Language Constraint

The system must be developed using Django (Python) for backend processing.

The frontend must be created using Django HTML templates and Bootstrap for responsiveness.


#### Database Constraint

The application must use SQLite for all data storage, including user profiles, preferences, reviews, and admin logs.


#### Security Standards

Passwords must be stored using salted and peppered hash encryption.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) must be used to differentiate between normal users and admin users.


#### Browser Compatibility

The system must work smoothly on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

The layout must be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.


#### External API Use

The layout must be responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The system relies on The Movie Database (TMDB) API. API call limits and availability must be considered during development.

A local cache mechanism must be used to prevent system failure if the API is down.


#### Compliance and Accessibility

The design must meet GDPR and CCPA privacy laws.

Accessibility must follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards (color contrast, keyboard navigation, etc.)


#### Performance

The system should load any page or search result in under 10 seconds, even with 100,000 concurrent users.

Backend queries must not exceed 250 milliseconds for common operations.


## Software System Attributes

This section describes the non-functional attributes of the system that impact its usability, reliability, performance, and security.


#### Usability

The Movie Recommender System will be easy to use and understand. It will work smoothly on computers, tablets, and mobile phones. The layout will be clean and simple, with clear buttons, icons, and menus that are always in the same place. This helps users find what they need without confusion. A help guide and small tips will be available to help new users learn how to use the system.


#### Reliability

The system is designed to maintain 99.99% uptime annually. It will continue functioning even if external APIs (e.g., TMDB) are temporarily unavailable, using a local caching mechanism to provide fallback data. Session recovery features will allow users to resume activity after temporary disconnections or timeouts.


#### Availability

The application will be hosted on scalable cloud infrastructure, capable of supporting high availability. Maintenance windows will be scheduled during low-traffic periods and will not exceed 30 minutes per month. A status page may be provided to alert users of downtime or disruptions.


#### Security

Security is ensured through the following:

Passwords stored with salted and peppered hash encryption.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate user and admin privileges.

Enforced HTTPS for all communication between the client and server.

Rate-limiting and brute-force protection for authentication endpoints.


#### Maintainability

The system is developed using the Django framework with modular architecture to promote maintainability. Components such as filters, user authentication, and movie recommendations are decoupled for easier debugging and updates. Well-documented code, logging mechanisms, and version control will support future maintenance and development.


#### Portability

Since the system runs in a web browser, it can be used on any device or operating system (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It will also be ready for mobile app development in the future, and the design will support that.


## Other Requirements

This section describes additional important requirements that do not directly fit into functional or interface categories but are still necessary for the system‚Äôs success.


#### Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

The system must comply with GDPR to protect user data privacy.

The system should follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

Documentation and system specifications should align with IEEE Standard 830-1998 for software requirements.


#### Software Quality Attributes

Usability: The system must be easy to use, with a clean and consistent layout, responsive design, and minimal learning curve for new users.

Scalability: The system must support high traffic and scale automatically to handle double peak user loads.

Performance: Search results and movie listings should be displayed within 2‚Äì5 seconds during normal conditions.

Security: All sensitive data (such as user accounts and preferences) must be stored securely using salted and peppered hashing, and all communications must be encrypted via HTTPS.


#### Business Rules

Only logged-in users are allowed to save, rate, or write reviews for movies.

User preferences, such as filters and settings, should be preserved even after logout.

Admin users have elevated access rights and can manage movie content, user data, and moderate reviews.

All users must agree to the terms of service and data policy during account registration.


#### API Usage and Fallback Mechanism

The system depends on The Movie Database (TMDB) API for most real-time content.

To avoid service disruption, a local caching system must be used to store frequently accessed data and ensure the app remains functional if the API is temporarily unavailable.

API requests should respect rate limits and include timeout and retry mechanisms for robustness.
